Main Task
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create accounts and home directories for the following users in the given formats (alias - userGenerate):
        ChiefCommander
        ArmyGeneral, NavyMarshal and AirForceChief
        50 soldiers under each category named in the format: Army1 to Army50, Navy1 to Navy50, and Airforce1 to AirForce50.
------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

 for i in ChiefCommander ArmyGeneral NavyMarshal AirForceChief
   do
     sudo useradd -m -d /home/$i $i 
     passwd $i
   done

 for a in Army Navy Airforce
   do
     for i in {1..50}
       do
         sudo useradd -m -d /home/$a$i $a$i
         passwd $a$i
       done
   done

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Assign them permissions as follows (alias - permit):
        The chief commander can access and modify any directory.
        The troop chiefs can access and modify any directory of their own troops and their own directory as well.
        The soldiers can only access and modify their own directories.
        Troop chiefs should not be able to access or modify any other troop chief's, any other troop soldier’s, or the chief commander's directory.
------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

sudo groupadd Army 
sudo groupadd Navy
sudo groupadd Airforce
 
sudo usermod -a -G Army,Navy,Airforce ChiefCommander
sudo usermod -a -G Army ArmyGeneral
sudo usermod -a -G Navy NavyMarshal
sudo usermod -a -G Airforce AirForceChief

 for a in Army Navy Airforce
   do
     for i in {1..50}
       do
         chown $a$i.$a /home/$a$i
         chmod 770 /home/$a$i
       done
   done

chown ArmyGeneral.Army /home/ArmyGeneral
chmod -R 770 /home/ArmyGeneral
chown NavyMarshal.Navy /home/NavyMarshal
chmod -R 770 /home/NavyMarshal
chown AirForceChief.Airforce /home/AirForceChief
chmod -R 770 /home/AirForceChief
chmod 700 /home/ChiefCommander
------------------------------------------------------------
3. You have been given a log file with time-stamps, username and the duty positions allotted to each soldier (position.log). Write a script for the following sub tasks (alias - autoSchedule):
        Create a text file named post_allotted in each soldier's home directory.
        Each file should have a table with 2 columns: Date and Post.
        Every day at 12 am there should be a scheduled update in each soldier’s table with their respective post for the next day.
------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

 for a in Army Navy Airforce
   do
     for i in {1..50}
       do
         touch /home/$a$i/post_allotted.txt
         printf "Date	       Post\n" > /home/$a$i/post_allotted.txt
       done
   done

---------------
crontab -e
00 00 * * * /bin/bash /home/ChiefCommander/a3.sh
---------------
#following code is in file and name is "a3.sh"
#!/bin/bash

tdDate1="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
 for a in Army Navy Airforce
   do
     for i in {1..50}
       do
         tdl="$(grep $tdDate1 position.log | grep -w $a$i)"
         IFS=' ' 
         read -ra lArry <<< "$tdl" 
         strDate="${lArry[0]}"
         subDate=${strDate:1:10}
         printf  "$subDate     ${lArry[2]} ${lArry[3]}\n" >> /home/$a$i/post_allotted.txt
       done
   done 

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Every day each soldier has to report at the post allotted to them. You are given an attendance log of whether the soldier was present. Write a script to automate the given sub tasks (alias - attendance):
        Create a text file in every troop chief’s home directory named attendance_record.
        This file should have a table with soldiers who were present at the posts allotted to them.
        This file should automatically update every morning at 6 am. You have been given another log file with the attendance record. (attendance.log)
------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

for a in Army Navy Airforce
   do
     touch /home/$a/attendance_record.txt
     printf "Date	       Soldier\n" > /home/$a/attendance_record.txt
   done
---------------
crontab -e
00 06 * * * /bin/bash /home/ChiefCommander/attend.sh
---------------
#file name = attend.sh
#!/bin/bash
tdDate1="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
 for a in Army Navy Airforce
   do
     for i in {1..50}
       do
         tdla="$(grep $tdDate1 attendance.log | grep -w $a$i)"
         IFS=' ' 
         read -ra lArrya <<< "$tdla" 
         if [ ${lArrya[2]} = "YES" ]
         then
           strDate="${lArrya[0]}"
           subDate=${strDate:1:10}
           printf "$subDate     ${lArrya[1]}\n" >> /home/$a/attendance_record.txt
         fi
       done
   done  

------------------------------------------------------------
5. Develop a script for each troop chief to fetch the attendance records of a day in a week (alias – record):
        For example, if the troop chief types "record 4" the script will show the attendance records of the 4th day of the previous week, that is Thursday. Set up the script to handle the variable accordingly.
------------------------------------------------------------
#example for troop chief army
#!/bin/bash

declare -i tn="$(date +%w)" 
declare -i gn=$1  
if [ $gn -ge $tn ]
then
    dd=$(( tn + 6 - gn + 1 ))
    pdate="$(date +%Y%m%d -d "-$dd days")"
    grep $pdate /home/Army/attendance_record.txt >> /home/Army/attendance_lastweekday.txt
else
    dd=$(( tn - gn ))
    pdate="$(date +%Y%m%d -d "-$dd days")"
    grep $pdate /home/Army/attendance_record.txt >> /home/Army/attendance_lastweekday.txt
fi
